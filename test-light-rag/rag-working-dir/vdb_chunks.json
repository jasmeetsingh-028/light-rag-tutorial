Areawise India ranks second while production wise it ranks third among the total onion production in the world. In the world total area under cultivation of onion is about 19,77,000 hectare which gives 2,79,18,000 mt. Major producing countries are North America, Japan, Spain, Netherland, Canada, etc. while in India it is grown in Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana. Area under cultivation in Maharashtra is about 54,600 hectare.\n\nClimate and Soil:\n\nAn ideal soil should have pH in between 6.5 to 8. The soil should be well aerated. Heavy soil should be avoided. It is grown under a wide range of climatic conditions. However, it cannot stand too hot or too cold weather. It prefers moderate temperature in summer as well as in winter. Short days are very favorable for the formation of bulbs. It can be grown well at elevations of 1000 to 1300 m above MSL. Onion requires well drained loamy soils, rich in humus, with fairly good content of potash. The crop raised on sandy or loose soil does soils, the bulbs produced are deformed and during harvesting, many bulbs are broken and bruised and so they do not keep well in storage.\n\nVarieties\nPusa Red, Pusa Ratnar, Pusa White Round, Patna Red, Poona Red, Arka Pragati, Arka Niketa, Patna White, Bombay White, Nasik Red.\n\nPlanting Habits:\nIt is grow as an annual or biennial. The smooth, glaucous scope grows from 1 to 3 feet high. The scope or stem is hollow and swollen above the base. The leaves are also swollen at base and hollow. Flowers, terminal, umbel, white or faint blue, numerous, develop bulbels. Underground bulb undeveloped like the stem. Propagation by Bulbels.\n\nPropagation\nOnion belong to bulb vegetables group. Onion seeds are sown in nursery from October to November. In south and eastern India from September to October. In hills from March to June. One hectare needs 8-10 kg seeds. Seedlings are transplanted in December and January. Early transplanting yields more. Bulb and bulb-lets are also sown but needs 1000-1200 kg. / hectare.\n\nPlanting\nThe seed of onion in the nursery from middle of October to the end of November. In the hills, the seed is sown from March to June. Planting distance for Onion (seedlings) is 15 X 10 or 20 X 10cm\n\nApplication of Manures and Fertilizer\nOnion F.Y.M. 200-250 g/hectare\n45-65 Kg N/hectare\n40-60 kg P/hectare\n60-100 kg K/hectare\n\nIrrigation:\nIrrigation during growth should be steady and uninterrupted otherwise dryness may cause splitting of the outer scales. Irrigation is stopped when the tops mature and start falling. Use F1 hybrids for higher yield.\n\nPlant Protection\nOnion\nPest\n\nThrips- Spray Malathion or Nuvacron (0.1%)\nBorer- Spray Endosulfan (0.1%)\nMaggot- Apply Thimet 10G to soil and spray Malathion (0.05%)\nDiseases\n\nDowny mildew- Spray Difolatan (0.1%) or Dithane M-45 (0.2%)\nSmut - Spray Captan, Biltox or Thiram 75%\nYield\nOnion gives a yield of 25 to 30 tones/hectare and garlic about 6 to 10 tonnes. Bulbs should be thoroughly cured before storage.\n\nStorage\nIn case of onion crop there are various factors affecting the storing conditions. Some important are listed below.\n\n1. Selection of Variety\n\n2. Fertilizers and water management\n\n3. Drying of onion\n\n4. Actual storage conditions\n\n5. Construction of storage structure\n\n1. Selection of Variety: In majority of the cases onion crop grown in rabi season are stored. This can be stored for about 4 to 5 months. In case of storage selection of variety is an important aspect where N 2-4-1, Agrifound light red, Arka niketan were found to be suitable one giving less percentage of losses.\n\n2. Fertilizers and water management: Doses of fertilizers, type of fertilizers and irrigation affects the storing capacity of onion / shelf life of onion. Organic matter increases the storing capacity of onion. Rate of fertilizer suggested is 150:50:50, N:P:K kg per hectare respectably. In case of irrigation according to soil tag crop should be irrigated.\n\n3. Drying of onion: Immediately after harvest let the onion should get dried for about 8 to 10 days which helps to remove the excess heat giving better colour to onion.\n\n4. Actual storage conditions: In case of storage condition temperature and humidity are the important parameters. Optimum temperature ranges from 25 to 30 0C and RH 65 to 70%. Excess humidity and temperature results in fungal growth. On the contrary decrease in humidity increases respiration rate causing weight loss. In May-June temperature is more and relative humidity is less which affects the weight loss. While in case of July-September temperature goes down resulting in sprouting of onion. To avoid these problems construction of proper storage structure is required.\n\n5.

High humidity associated with cloudy weather results into spread of fungal diseases like damping off and powdery mildew etc., but light rains followed by bright sunshine is good for the crop.\n\nSoil requirements:\n\nPea needs medium soil type ranging from sandy clayey loam free from soluble salts. The soil must be well drained as water logging is extremely harmful for the growth, development and even or survival. It does well under neutral soil reaction with a soil pH of 6.5 to 7.5.\n\n \n\nLand preparation:\n\n \n\nField preparation is very similar to any Rabi crop but the soil should not be very pulverised and fine, however, it must be free from all established weeds and stubbles of the kharif crop grown earlier. Under rainfed conditions it must be treated with 20-25 kg. Of 5% BHC or heptachlor dust so that there is no attack of termites. The bed should be thoroughly levelled, especially in case of irrigated condition for proper distribution of irrigation water.\n\n \n\nFertilizer management:\n\n \n\nIt is recommended to apply about 15-20 tonnes of well decomposed organic manure like compost or F.Y.M. in case of very light soils supplemented with 15-20 kg nitrogen/ha, 60-80 kg phosphorus, 20-30 kg potash and 15-20 kg zinc sulphate (once after three years) per hectare. The entire quantity of manures and fertilizers should be basal placed about 10-15 cm deep in furrows (3 to 5 cm below the seed layer).\n\n \n\nWater management:\n\n \n\nThe soil should have sufficient moisture at the time of sowing so that the seeds may germinate well. The crop, after germination, needs two light irrigations which should be given at 45-50 days and 75 days after sowing or first at flowering and second at pod filling stage of the crop. In all it needs about 153.7 mm water.\n\n \n\nWeed control:\n\n \n\nTwo hand weedings at 20 and 45 days after sowing. In case if the weeding is not possible, use of chemical should be done. Basalin at 0.75 kg a.i./ha may be applied as pre-plant soil incorporation or Tribunil at 2.5 kg/ha as pre-emergence spray which may be a substitute for Basalin and it controls all the weeds.\n\n \n\nPlant protection measures:\n\n \n\nDiseases:\n\nThe crop is mostly attacked by wilt, root-rot and powdery mildew which may be controlled by adopting the following measures:\n\n \n\nWilt and root rot:\n\nSelect wilt resistant varieties.\nAvoid early sowing to avoid high humidity and high temperature which are congenial for the diseases.\nAlways use treated seed with Ceresan or Captan by taking 2 to 2.5 g of chemical/kg seed.\nAdopt crop rotation.\n \n\nPowdery mildew:\n\nSelect powdery mildew resistant varieties, like Rachana, Hans, etc.\nAvoid late sowing of the crop.\nThe crop should be sprayed with any of the wettable sulphur compound like Sulfex, Elosal or Hexasual by using 0.3 per cent solution. The disease needs two or three sprayings-first when disease appears, second after a fortnight and third, if required, after a fortnight of the second spraying.\nDusting with sulphur may be adopted if spraying is not possible.\n \n\nInsect-pests:\n\nPests are not very common in peas but sometimes the crop is attacked by shoot fly, caterpillar, and aphids. Of these, the shoot fly and caterpillars may be controlled by spraying of 0.05 per cent. Thiodan at fortnightly interval. Two to three spraying will be enough to control the pest. The aphids may be controlled by spraying with 0.4 per cent of Menazon or 0.25 per cent of Dimecron at 8-10 days intervals.\n\n \n\nCharacteristic features of some of important pea cultivars:\n\n \n\nA.

It has a special value as food. The consumption of potato per head is very low in India as compared to that of Western Countries. Potato belongs to family Solanaceae and botanical name is Solanum tuberosum.\n\nVarieties\nThere are many varieties of potatoes either introduced into or bred in India some of the important newly improved varieties are described below.\n\nKufri Sinduri:\n\nMedium maturing (31/2 to 41/2 months) with round, light red medium-sized tubers. It is suitable for cultivation as a main crop variety in plains as a replacement to Kufri Red and other later varieties.\n\nKufri Chandramukhi:\n\nEarly maturing (mature 10 days earlier than upto-date), with attractive, oval, white tubers. It degenerates so slowly and keeps well in storage. It gives high yields and cooks easily and does not degenerate rapidly in the plains.\n\nKufri Khasi-Garo:\n\nAn early maturing variety, possessing a good degree of field resistance to late blight and moderate resistance to early blight and viruses, fit for growing in the hilly regions of Assam.\n\nKufri Chamatkar:\n\nAn early bulking variety with uniform-sized, shining and smoothed tubers.\n\nKufri Shectorn:\n\nA front-resistant variety, suitable especially for the Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana and U.P. It can be planted late in the northern plains due to its high degree of resistance frost.\n\nKufri Jyoti:\n\nA widely adaptable, fertilizer-resistant variety possessing a high degree of field resistance to late blight disease in the foliage and also a good degree of tuber resistance to the same disease. This variety is also resistant to the wary disease and moderately resistant to cercospora leaf blotch.\n\nKufri Alankar:\n\nA very early-tubering photo insensitive variety capable of giving high yields, suitable for cultivation in the plains of Northern India.\n\nKufri Jeewan:\n\nA late-maturing high-yielding variety, possessing a high degree of field resistance to late blight, resistance to the wart and Cercospora diseases.\n\nClimate and Soil:\n\nPotato can be grown well in fertile and well-drained soil. Potato grows well in soil having pH 4.8-5.4. Heavy soil should be avoided. The short day conditions are highly favourable for economic yield of potato crops. To secure good for potato a day length of 12-13 hours is needed and night temperature 200 C increase tuberization.\n\nPlanting Habits:\nThe potato belongs to family Solanaceae. It is a harbaceos annual and propagated by tubers, the thick underground stems which are called stolons. The stolon are slender, arising from buds, length and diameter varies with varieties. Eyes on the potato are buds and one or more develops into stem and leaves. Stem may be green, purple or light violet. Leaves are compound with opposite leaflets. Stems and leaves prostrate or erect. Height of plant one to two feet depending on variety. Roots are shallow and superficial, extend upto two feet. Flowers are about an inch in diameter, corolla white to purple or violet. Fruit is a berry but commonly not developed, spherical, half to one inch in diameter, purple or black. Seeds are about the size of mustard, hetrozygous, not use for propagation except for breeding purpose. The size, shape, colour of skin of tubers varies with variety. The flush colour may be white, light yellow, pink or light blue.\n\nPlanting\nPotato is grown in rabi season during October to December with seed rate 1.40 kg for 10 sq. meter area. The planting distance for potato crop is 50 X 20 and 60 X 25 cm.\n\nApplication of Manures and Fertilizer\nF.Y.M.  250-400 g/hectare\n           120-160 kg/hectare N\n            80-120 kg/hectare P\n            80-120 kg/hectare K\nTo be incorporated into the soil 3 to 4 weeks before planting half dose of nitrogen full dose of P2O5 and K2O as basal dressing at planting and remaining nitrogen dose is given at the time of earthing up.\n\nIrrigation:\nPotato needs irrigation at frequent intervals, depending upon the soil and climatic conditions. Usually 6 irrigation is sufficient. Pre-sowing irrigation followed by 5-6 light irrigations.\n\nYield\nPotato is harvested from the time it is sufficient size until the vines are fully ripe. The average yield varies from 20 to 30 tonnes per hectare. The best method storing potato is in cold stores at 2.20 C to 3.30 C and at 75 to 80% relative humidity.\n\nPlant Protection\nPests\n\nCut worms – Spray Dursban 20 EC or apply Phorate in soil.\nCaterpillar – Spray Thiodan or BHC (10%)\nAphid -- Spray Rogor or Nuvacron or Malathion\nJassids -- Spray Metasystox (0.1%)\nDiseases\n\nNematodes -- Fumigate soil with D-D\nEarly Blight – Spray Dithane M-45 (0.2%)\nLate blight -- Spray Dithane M-45 or Dithane Z-78 or Difolatan or Zineb.\nScab --Disinfect tubers with Agallol-6 or Mercuric fungicides.\nVirus disease – Use certified seeds.

It then arrived in Korea, the Philippines (about 2000 B. C.) and then Japan and Indonesia (about 1000 B. C.).\n\nIn the Indian subcontinent more than a quarter of the cultivated land is given to rice (20011-12). It is a very essential part of the daily meal in the southern and eastern parts of India. In the northern and central parts of the subcontinent, where wheat is frequently eaten, rice holds its own and is cooked daily as well as on festivals and special occasions.\n\nClimatic Requirements:\nIn India rice is grown under widely varying conditions of altitude and climate. Rice crop needs a hot and humid climate. It is best suited to regions which have high humidity, prolonged sunshine and an assured supply of water.\nThe average temperature required throughout to the crop throughout its life ranges from 21 to 37º C. Maximum temp in which the crop can grow is 400C to 42 0C.\n\nNutritional value of Rice:\nCarbohydrate (starch) is the important component of rice due to which it provides instant energy. Rice is poor in nitrogenous substances with average composition of these substances being only 8 per cent and fat content or lipids only negligible, i.e., 1per cent and due to this reason it is considered as a complete food for eating.\nRice flour is rich in starch and is used for making various food materials. It is also used in some instances by brewers to make alcoholic malt.\n\nMedicinal Value:\nThe various varieties of rice germplasm is a rich source for many rice based products. It is also helps in treating many health related issues such as indigestion, diabetes, arthritis, paralysis, epilepsy. Medicinal rice varieties like Kanthi Banko (Chhattisgarh), Meher, Saraiphul & Danwar (Orissa), Atikaya & Kari Bhatta (Karnataka), are very common in India.\n\nCrop Production Practices:\nIn India Rice is mainly grown in two types of soils i.e., (i) uplands and (ii) low lands. The crop of rice is grown with the following methods:\n1. Dry or Semi-dry upland cultivation\nBroadcasting the seed\nSowing the seed behind the plough or drilling\n\n2. Wet or lowland cultivation\nTransplanting in puddled fields.\nBroadcasting sprouted seeds in puddled fields.\n\nSelection of Seeds:\nThe use of quality seeds in cultivation of rice is an important factor to get better crop yield. Seeds intended for sowing should satisfy the following requirements:\n- The seed should belong to the proper variety, which is proposed to be grown.\n- The seed should be clean and free from obvious mixtures of other seeds.\n- The seed should be mature, well developed and plump in size.\n- The seed should be free from obvious signs of age or bad storage.\n- The seed should have a high germinating capacity.\n- Before sowing the seed should be treated with fungicides which protects the seed against soil-born fungi and also give a boost to the seedlings.\n\nSoil:\nPaddy is grown in wide range of soil. Fertile riverine alluvial soil is best for rice cultivation. Clayey loam soil in monsoon land is considered to be the best for rice cultivation as water retention capacity of this soil is very high.\n\nFertilizers:\nNitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are three essential plant nutrients required for rice. Most of the paddy lands have a moderate quantity of such nutrients, but if they are deficient, organic manure or artificial fertilizers have to be used.", "full_doc_id": "doc-70c5d89a16d65b263ef2f3704cd7ca8a", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-5470ec64d5d6e0a733bc41912ea3c5b5", "__created_at__": 1756213052, "content": "Ecological Requirements:\nClimate-\nSoyabean needs about 15 to 320C temperature for germination but for rapid growth the crop needs higher temperature.

India is the world’s largest consumer and the second largest producer of sugar, topped only by Brazil. Nearly 2.8 lakh farmers have been cultivating sugarcane in the vast area of 4.4 lakh acres and over 11 crore people are directly or indirectly dependent on the sugar industry in the country. Sugarcane is one of the important commercial crops of India, grown in an area of 3.93 m.ha with annual production of 170 M.T. Sugarcane productivity in India is around 67 t/ha. It is one of the most important food-cum-cash crop grown in the country, providing employment to a larger number of people, in addition to earning considerable foreign exchange.\n\nRequirement\nClimate\nSugarcane is able to grow over a prolonged season. Under warm humid conditions, it can continue its growth, unless terminated by flowering. Temperatures above 50o C arrest its growth; those below 20 o C slow it down markedly and severe frost proves fatal. The crop does best in the tropical regions receiving a rainfall of 750-1200mm. For ripening, it needs a cool, dry season; but where rainfall is too heavy and prolonged, the quality of the juice tends to be low, and where the weather remains comparatively.\n\nSoil\nSugarcane grows best on medium heavy soils, but can also be raised on lighter soils and heavy clays, provided there is adequate irrigation available in the former type of soils and drainage is good in the latter type of soils. In many places, dark rich clay loams, 120-150cm deep, and lying on a previous substratum of murum (distintegrated traprock) ae used for this crop. In some areas.\n\nVarieties\nCO – 419, CO – 740, CO – 7219 (Sanjivini), CO.M – 7125, CO – 7527, CO.M – 88121(7714), CO –8014 (Mahalaxmi), CO – 86032 (Nira), CO.C – 671, CO.C – 85061, CO - 8011, CO.M. – 7114, CO.S.I – 776,\n\nPlanting\nSeed treatment\nThe availability of good quality cane seed materials (setts) from a nursery crop of 10-11 months are essential for better germination and good growth. The treatments included were namely control, 0.05% Bavistin, 2.5% Urea, 2.5% KCI, 2.5% KCI+Urea, 1% Hadron. Two budded setts were used for planting after treating with above chemicals. Also hot water treatment is given to prevent seed borne diseases.\n\nSowing\nPlanting of sugarcane is done in three seasons that is suru- January-February, adsali - July-August and pre seasonal- October-November for planting generally ridges and furrows are prepared on 100-120cm spacing. For planting one hectare area 25-30 thousand three eye buded cane setts are required.\n\nFertilizers\nAdequate manuring is essential for sustained high yields. The general recommendation in most places is to apply half to two-thirds of the nitrogen in the form of bulky organic manures, such as farmyard manure, compost, green manure or tree leaves, and the remainder in the form of ammonium sulphate or oil-cakes or a combination of the two. For sugarcane fertilizer is recommended according to planting season and it is varied from growing tract to tract. In general for suru sugarcane 250:115:115 for Adsali 400:170:170 and for pre seasonal 340:170:170 kg nitrogen, phosphorus and potash per hectare is recommended respectively. For ratooning 250:115:115kg nitrogen, phosphorus and potash per hectare is recommended.\n\nIrrigation\nWater requirement of sugarcane varies from 2000 to 2500 mm depending upon its duration, soil type and climatological factors. For sugarcane germination, tillering, grand growth and maturity are the critical stages for irrigation. During germination phase (1-35 days) there should be enough moisture in the soil for better germination but waterlogging is undesirable as it leads to rotting of setts. During this period irrigation can be scheduled at weekly intervals. But irrigation at 10 days interval during tillering stage (36-100 days) is sufficient. The formative and grand growth stages (101-270 days) are the critical stages for water demand. During this period irrigation can be practised at weekly intervals. At the maturity phase (271 days to harvest) fortnightly irrigation is enough. Irrigation will have to be stopped at 15 days prior to harvest.\n\nIntercultural operations\nMulching\nIn early days, application of paddy straw or spreading of sugarcane trash in the field will decrease the evaporation and thus decrease the water demand of the crop besides improving the yield.\n\nHoeing and earthing-up\nThe first hoeing an weeding should be given to the crop three to four weeks after planting. After germination, depending on the field conditions and the frequency of irrigation, two or three more hoeings and weedings may be required during the first three months after planting with the coming up of the crop. The final earthing-up should be completed before the monsoon rains, and should generally synchronize with the application of the final dose of fertilizer. This helps to keep down the weeds.\n\nTying of cane\nIt is very desirable to tie up the canes so that they may not sway during the winds, and lodge", "full_doc_id": "doc-d21a78c384a2e57b0ec12b38d360f0c7", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-252cf8bb716d1836b2636ff6ef75ea1a", "__created_at__": 1756213094, "content": "on the field conditions and the frequency of irrigation, two or three more hoeings and weedings may be required during the first three months after planting with the coming up of the crop.

This helps to keep down the weeds.\n\nTying of cane\nIt is very desirable to tie up the canes so that they may not sway during the winds, and lodge. The best way to do the tying is to bring together the stalks from adjacent rows and tie them together with their own trash and old leaves. In many places cane is tied at two or three levels with twists of cane trash, the twistline going from one end of the row to the other; sometimes the stalks are further propped up with bamboos.\n\nPlant protection\nPest\nTermites\nTermites are attack planted sugarcane setts, usually from the cut ends or eyebuds, but in severe cases internode as well; after germination, the roots are attacked and pest ascends in the canes, eating all their contents and filling the galleries with earth; leaves dry up and the plants die; more active in sandy soils and in drier tracts.\n\nControl\nUse only well-rotted manure, mix thoroughly 5% Aldrin or Chlordane dust with the soil; if the standing crop is attacked, apply Aldrin E.C. at 3kg a.i/ha diluted with 2,000 litres of water as near the roots as possible.\n\nEarly shoot-borer\nCausing dead-hearts which can be easily pulled out; the maximum activity is observed during April to August; responsible for serious losses in tonnage and sugar recovery.\nControl\nPractice cleans cultivation; plant healthy setts; give two light stage of the crop; avoid ratooning; systematically collect and destroy egg masses; remove dead-hearts and do deep harvesting.\n\nInternode borer\nNewly hatched caterpillars scrape the leaf spindle; later, they bore into the tender cane tops; the growing-point is damaged and results in a dead-heart; active from July till harvest; the pest causes more loss in tonnage than in juice quality.\n\nControl\nBurn all trash after harvest; Practice clean cultivation; collect and destroy egg masses and larvae during early stages of crop.\n\nDisease\nRed rot\nIt is a fungal disease. The symptoms of the disease will appear when the crop is about six months old. At the initial stage, drying of top leaves can be seen. The leaf starts withering and drooping almost all shoots in a clump starts drying one by one. Red lesions with straw coloured centres develop on the midrib of leaves.\nControl\nUproot and destroy all the clumps as soon as symptoms appear. Avoid ratooning. Use disease free and heat-treated setts for planting. After harvest, collect and burn the plant debris. Grow resistant varieties like CO-7706, CO-86032 and tolerant varieties are CO-8021 and CO-62175.\nFollow crop rotation. Dip the setts in systemic fungicide Benomyl (0.1%) solution for at least 30 minutes before planting.\n\nWhip smut\nIt is fungal disease. The symptoms can be seen on the crop from the time it is one month old upto harvesting time. The affected young plants show excessive tillering and at the end of each shoot, a black whip like structure, full of fungal spores is produced.\n\nControl\nUse disease free and heat-treated setts for planting. Dip the setts in Carbendazim solution (0.1%) before planting at least for 30 minutes. Uproot and destroy the infected clumps. Avoid ratooning. Grow resistant varieties like CO-85004, CO-86032, CO-6608, CO-6609, CO-62101, CO-1342, CO-12582, CO-8021 and CO-62175.\n\nGrassy shoot disease\nThis disease is caused by Mycoplasma like organism and is severe on ratoon crop than on the main crop. Symptoms are stunting, profuse tillering and grass like growth of shoots (busy appearance) and yellowing of leaves with short internodes.\n\nControl\nUse disease free and heat-treated setts for planting. Uproot and destroy the infected clumps.\nAvoid ratooning. Spray Endosulfan (0.2%) to kill insect vectors i.e., aphids which transmit the disease. Use resistant varieties like CO-7219, CO-740, CO-8014 and CO-8011.\n\nHarvesting and yield\nAssessing the maturity of the cane crop\nThe maturity of sugarcane is generally recognized by the lower leaves gradually withering up and leaving progressively fewer green leaves at the top. A ripe cane, out across with a sharp knife, shows against sunlight a slight sparkling in its flesh in contrast to the more watery cut surface of an unripe cane. If the grower can keep and use a hand sugar refractometer, the testing of maturity would be easier. The hand refractometer reading of 20, the cane crop may be considered to have reached the stage of maturity. Small Mill Test (SMT) will be a real solution for this perennial problem. For conducting SMT, few canes (say about 10 canes) have to be cut from the field and the samples are analyzed after crushing the cane in a small mill for poll, brix, purity and ccs% in the laboratory which clearly gives the maturity status of the cane.\n\nHarvesting system and harvesting unit\nThe Cooperative generally begins the sugarcane harvest about the first of November and continues for an average of 150 days.

The sugarcane harvest is timed and coordinated undertaking to allow for maximum utilization of the mill's grinding capacity. At present the harvesting and supply of sugarcane is done by the farmers after receiving the cutting orders from the factory authorities. The cutting orders are issued depending upon the date of planting as found in the records and agreement between the farmers and factory. This system will not hold good, as uniform maturity of the cane crop can’t be controlled even by planting early maturing varieties in the early season. In a typical harvesting unit, three or four harvesters operate in tandem with six to eight tractors and strings of wagons. The huge machines contain rotating knives, which cut the sugarcane at the base of the stalk. The cane tops are also cut off by rotating knives and the excess foliage is removed by giant extraction fans. As the sugarcane passes through the harvester, it is cut into 12-inch lengths called billets and then put into in-field wagons. The sugarcane is then hauled to near-by transfer stations and loaded into semi-trailers for delivery.\n\nYield\nThe average yield of a 11 to 12 month-old plant crop under commercial cultivation is 100 tonnes per hectare in case of suru, 170 tonnes per hectare for Adsali and 120 tonnes per hectare in case of pre seasonal sugarcane.", "full_doc_id": "doc-d21a78c384a2e57b0ec12b38d360f0c7", "file_path": "unknown_source"}, {"__id__": "chunk-e968055d4514b326b9a06d03b268f864", "__created_at__": 1756213144, "content": "Introduction\nSunflower (Helianthus annuus L). is mainly grown for its oil. The oil is used for culinary purpose in the preparation of vanaspati and in the manufacture of soaps and cosmetics. Its cake is rich in protein and is used as a cattle and poultry feed.\n\nRequirement\nClimate\nThis crop requires a cool climate during germination and seedling growth, warm weather from the seedling stage up to flowering and non-cloudy, sunny days during flowering to maturity.\nSoil\nIt performs well in deep, neutral and well-drained light soils as well as in heavy soils. The optimum pH of the soils for this crop is 6.5-8.5.\nVarieties\n\nE.C.68413 (Vniimk 8931), E.C. 68414 (Peredovick), E.C. 68415 (Armavirskij), E.C. 68414 (Peredovick), E.C. 68415 (Armavirskij), E.C. 69874 (Armaverts) and Sunrise. Recently, a short-duration variety, E.C. 101495 (Cernianka).\n\nLand preparation and sowing\n\nSunflower is one crop in the case of which, the season of planting are not the limiting factors. Three to four ploughing and diskings are sufficient for preparing the land. Soil should be moist at least 10cm deep before sowing and this condition necessitates good soaking rains or irrigation before sowing. Seed rate is 8-10kg of well-filled seeds per hectare. For controlling seed-borne fungal diseases, seed treatment with either Brassical or Captan @3g per kg of seed is recommended. The pre-soaking of seed for 12-24 hours ensures a rapid and high percentage of germination, an early emergence and establishment of the crop. The seed is drilled at a depth of 5cm by adopting a spacing of 45cm between rows and 30cm between plants in the row.\n\nFertilizers\nThe crop performs best when both organic and inorganic fertilizers are applied to it. The fertilizer Nitrogen:Phosphrous:Potash (NPK) schedules recommended in the case of rainfed and irrigated crops are 20:30:20 and 40:60:40 kg (NPK) of per hectare, respectively.\n\nIrrigation\nIn general, for light soils 9-10 and for heavy soils 5-6 irrigations are sufficient.

The crop has to be harvested when the lower side of the head turns yellow and some of the bracts dry up. The mature heads are cut with a sickle and are dried by exposing the upper side with seeds to the sun. The well-dried heads are beaten with sticks to separate the seeds. The cleaned seed is dried well and stored in gunny bags. The sunflower crop gives a grain yield of 300-500 kg per ha under rainfed conditions and 800-1200 kg per ha when grown under irrigation.", "full_doc_id": "doc-e968055d4514b326b9a06d03b268f864",

The\n     problem has always been not to find but to choose. There is the long\n     row of year-books which fill a shelf, and there are the\n     dispatch-cases filled with documents, a perfect quarry for the\n     student not only of crime but of the social and official scandals of\n     the late Victorian era. Concerning these latter, I may say that the\n     writers of agonized letters, who beg that the honour of their\n     families or the reputation of famous forebears may not be touched,\n     have nothing to fear. The discretion and high sense of professional\n     honour which have always distinguished my friend are still at work in\n     the choice of these memoirs, and no confidence will be abused. I\n     deprecate, however, in the strongest way the attempts which have been\n     made lately to get at and to destroy these papers. The source of\n     these outrages is known, and if they are repeated I have Mr. Holmes's\n     authority for saying that the whole story concerning the politician,\n     the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant will be given to the\n     public. There is at least one reader who will understand.\n\n     It is not reasonable to suppose that every one of these cases gave\n     Holmes the opportunity of showing those curious gifts of instinct and\n     observation which I have endeavoured to set forth in these memoirs.\n     Sometimes he had with much effort to pick the fruit, sometimes it\n     fell easily into his lap. But the most terrible human tragedies were\n     often involved in those cases which brought him the fewest personal\n     opportunities, and it is one of these which I now desire to record.\n     In telling it, I have made a slight change of name and place, but\n     otherwise the facts are as stated.\n\n     One forenoon--it was late in 1896--I received a hurried note from\n     Holmes asking for my attendance. When I arrived I found him seated in\n     a smoke-laden atmosphere, with an elderly, motherly woman of the\n     buxom landlady type in the corresponding chair in front of him.\n\n     \"This is Mrs. Merrilow, of South Brixton,\" said my friend with a wave\n     of the hand. \"Mrs. Merrilow does not object to tobacco, Watson, if\n     you wish to indulge your filthy habits. Mrs. Merrilow has an\n     interesting story to tell which may well lead to further developments\n     in which your presence may be useful.\"\n\n     \"Anything I can do--\"\n\n     \"You will understand, Mrs. Merrilow, that if I come to Mrs. Ronder I\n     should prefer to have a witness. You will make her understand that\n     before we arrive.\"\n\n     \"Lord bless you, Mr. Holmes,\" said our visitor, \"she is that anxious\n     to see you that you might bring the whole parish at your heels!\"\n\n     \"Then we shall come early in the afternoon. Let us see that we have\n     our facts correct before we start. If we go over them it will help\n     Dr. Watson to understand the situation. You say that Mrs. Ronder has\n     been your lodger for seven years and that you have only once seen her\n     face.\"\n\n     \"And I wish to God I had not!\" said Mrs. Merrilow.\n\n     \"It was, I understand, terribly mutilated.\"\n\n     \"Well, Mr. Holmes, you would hardly say it was a face at all. That's\n     how it looked. Our milkman got a glimpse of her once peeping out of\n     the upper window, and he dropped his tin and the milk all over the\n     front garden. That is the kind of face it is. When I saw her--I\n     happened on her unawares--she covered up quick, and then she said,\n     'Now, Mrs. Merrilow, you know at last why it is that I never raise my\n     veil.'\"\n\n     \"Do you know anything about her history?\"\n\n     \"Nothing at all.\"\n\n     \"Did she give references when she came?\"\n\n     \"No, sir, but she gave hard cash, and plenty of it. A quarter's rent\n     right down on the table in advance and no arguing about terms. In\n     these times a poor woman like me can't afford to turn down a chance\n     like that.\"\n\n     \"Did she give any reason for choosing your house?\"\n\n     \"Mine stands well back from the road and is more private than most.\n     Then, again, I only take the one, and I have no family of my own. I\n     reckon she had tried others and found that mine suited her best. It's\n     privacy she is after, and she is ready to pay for it.\"\n\n     \"You say that she never showed her face from first to last save on\n     the one accidental occasion. Well, it is a very remarkable story,\n     most remarkable, and I don't wonder that you want it examined.\"\n\n     \"I don't, Mr. Holmes. I am quite satisfied so long as I get my rent.\n     You could not have a quieter lodger, or one who gives less trouble.\"\n\n     \"Then what has brought matters to a head?\"\n\n     \"Her health, Mr. Holmes. She seems to be wasting away. And there's\n######################\nOutput:",

However, our speculations are futile until we have all the\n     facts. There is a cold partridge on the sideboard, Watson, and a\n     bottle of Montrachet. Let us renew our energies before we make a\n     fresh call upon them.\"\n\n     When our hansom deposited us at the house of Mrs. Merrilow, we found\n     that plump lady blocking up the open door of her humble but retired\n     abode. It was very clear that her chief preoccupation was lest she\n     should lose a valuable lodger, and she implored us, before showing us\n     up, to say and do nothing which could lead to so undesirable an end.\n     Then, having reassured her, we followed her up the straight, badly\n     carpeted staircase and were shown into the room of the mysterious\n     lodger.\n\n     It was a close, musty, ill-ventilated place, as might be expected,\n     since its inmate seldom left it. From keeping beasts in a cage, the\n     woman seemed, by some retribution of fate, to have become herself a\n     beast in a cage. She sat now in a broken armchair in the shadowy\n     corner of the room. Long years of inaction had coarsened the lines of\n     her figure, but at some period it must have been beautiful, and was\n     still full and voluptuous. A thick dark veil covered her face, but it\n     was cut off close at her upper lip and disclosed a perfectly shaped\n     mouth and a delicately rounded chin. I could well conceive that she\n     had indeed been a very remarkable woman. Her voice, too, was well\n     modulated and pleasing.\n\n     \"My name is not unfamiliar to you, Mr. Holmes,\" said she. \"I thought\n     that it would bring you.\"\n\n     \"That is so, madam, though I do not know how you are aware that I was\n     interested in your case.\"\n\n     \"I learned it when I had recovered my health and was examined by Mr.\n     Edmunds, the county detective. I fear I lied to him. Perhaps it would\n     have been wiser had I told the truth.\"\n\n     \"It is usually wiser to tell the truth. But why did you lie to him?\"\n\n     \"Because the fate of someone else depended upon it. I know that he\n     was a very worthless being, and yet I would not have his destruction\n     upon my conscience. We had been so close--so close!\"\n\n     \"But has this impediment been removed?\"\n\n     \"Yes, sir. The person that I allude to is dead.\"\n\n     \"Then why should you not now tell the police anything you know?\"\n\n     \"Because there is another person to be considered. That other person\n     is myself. I could not stand the scandal and publicity which would\n     come from a police examination. I have not long to live, but I wish\n     to die undisturbed. And yet I wanted to find one man of judgment to\n     whom I could tell my terrible story, so that when I am gone all might\n     be understood.\"\n\n     \"You compliment me, madam. At the same time, I am a responsible\n     person. I do not promise you that when you have spoken I may not\n     myself think it my duty to refer the case to the police.\"\n\n     \"I think not, Mr. Holmes. I know your character and methods too well,\n     for I have followed your work for some years. Reading is the only\n     pleasure which fate has left me, and I miss little which passes in\n     the world. But in any case, I will take my chance of the use which\n     you may make of my tragedy. It will ease my mind to tell it.\"\n\n     \"My friend and I would be glad to hear it.\"\n\n     The woman rose and took from a drawer the photograph of a man. He was\n     clearly a professional acrobat, a man of magnificent physique, taken\n     with his huge arms folded across his swollen chest and a smile\n     breaking from under his heavy moustache--the self-satisfied smile of\n     the man of many conquests.\n\n     \"That is Leonardo,\" she said.\n\n     \"Leonardo, the strong man, who gave evidence?\"\n\n     \"The same. And this--this is my husband.\"\n\n     It was a dreadful face--a human pig, or rather a human wild boar, for\n     it was formidable in its bestiality. One could imagine that vile\n     mouth champing and foaming in its rage, and one could conceive those\n     small, vicious eyes darting pure malignancy as they looked forth upon\n     the world. Ruffian, bully, beast--it was all written on that\n     heavy-jowled face.\n\n     \"Those two pictures will help you, gentlemen, to understand the\n     story. I was a poor circus girl brought up on the sawdust, and doing\n     springs through the hoop before I was ten. When I became a woman this\n     man loved me, if such lust as his can be called love, and in an evil\n     moment I became his wife. From that day I was in hell, and he the\n     devil who tormented me. There was no one in the show who did not know\n     of his treatment. He deserted me for others. He tied me down and\n     lashed me with his riding-whip when I complained. They all pitied me\n     and they all loathed him, but what could they do? They feared him,\n     one and all. For he was terrible at all times, and murderous when he\n     was drunk\n######################\nOutput:",

They were on their\n     way to Wimbledon, travelling by road, and they were simply camping\n     and not exhibiting, as the place is so small a one that it would not\n     have paid them to open.\n\n     \"They had among their exhibits a very fine North African lion.

Sometimes one went, sometimes both, but they never allowed\n     anyone else to do it, for they believed that so long as they were the\n     food-carriers he would regard them as benefactors and would never\n     molest them. On this particular night, seven years ago, they both\n     went, and a very terrible happening followed, the details of which\n     have never been made clear.\n\n     \"It seems that the whole camp was roused near midnight by the roars\n     of the animal and the screams of the woman.

The different grooms and\n     employees rushed from their tents, carrying lanterns, and by their\n     light an awful sight was revealed. Ronder lay, with the back of his\n     head crushed in and deep claw-marks across his scalp, some ten yards\n     from the cage, which was open. Close to the door of the cage lay Mrs.\n     Ronder upon her back, with the creature squatting and snarling above\n     her. It had torn her face in such a fashion that it was never thought\n     that she could live. Several of the circus men, headed by Leonardo,\n     the strong man, and Griggs, the clown, drove the creature off with\n     poles, upon which it sprang back into the cage and was at once locked\n     in. How it had got loose was a mystery. It was conjectured that the\n     pair intended to enter the cage, but that when the door was loosed\n     the creature bounded out upon them. There was no other point of\n     interest in the evidence save that the woman in a delirium of agony\n     kept screaming, 'Coward! Coward!' as she was carried back to the van\n     in which they lived. It was six months before she was fit to give\n     evidence, but the inquest was duly held, with the obvious verdict of\n     death from misadventure.\"\n\n     \"What alternative could be conceived?\" said I.\n\n     \"You may well say so. And yet there were one or two points which\n     worried young Edmunds, of the Berkshire Constabulary. A smart lad\n     that! He was sent later to Allahabad. That was how I came into the\n     matter, for he dropped in and smoked a pipe or two over it.\"\n\n     \"A thin, yellow-haired man?\"\n\n     \"Exactly. I was sure you would pick up the trail presently.\"\n\n     \"But what worried him?\"\n\n     \"Well, we were both worried. It was so deucedly difficult to\n     reconstruct the affair. Look at it from the lion's point of view. He\n     is liberated. What does he do? He takes half a dozen bounds forward,\n     which brings him to Ronder. Ronder turns to fly--the claw-marks were\n     on the back of his head--but the lion strikes him down. Then, instead\n     of bounding on and escaping, he returns to the woman, who was close\n     to the cage, and he knocks her over and chews her face up. Then,\n     again, those cries of hers would seem to imply that her husband had\n     in some way failed her. What could the poor devil have done to help\n     her? You see the difficulty?\"\n\n     \"Quite.\"\n\n     \"And then there was another thing. It comes back to me now as I think\n     it over. There was some evidence that just at the time the lion\n     roared and the woman screamed, a man began shouting in terror.\"\n\n     \"This man Ronder, no doubt.\"\n\n     \"Well, if his skull was smashed in you would hardly expect to hear\n     from him again. There were at least two witnesses who spoke of the\n     cries of a man being mingled with those of a woman.\"\n\n     \"I should think the whole camp was crying out by then. As to the\n     other points, I think I could suggest a solution.\"\n\n     \"I should be glad to consider it.\"\n\n     \"The two were together, ten yards from the cage, when the lion got\n     loose. The man turned and was struck down. The woman conceived the\n     idea of getting into the cage and shutting the door. It was her only\n     refuge. She made for it, and just as she reached it the beast bounded\n     after her and knocked her over. She was angry with her husband for\n     having encouraged the beast's rage by turning. If they had faced it\n     they might have cowed it. Hence her cries of 'Coward!'\"\n\n     \"Brilliant, Watson! Only one flaw in your diamond.\"\n\n     \"What is the flaw, Holmes?\"\n\n     \"If they were both ten paces from the cage, how came the beast to get\n     loose?\"\n\n     \"Is it possible that they had some enemy who loosed it?\"\n\n     \"And why should it attack them savagely when it was in the habit of\n     playing with them, and doing tricks with them inside the cage?\"\n\n     \"Possibly the same enemy had done something to enrage it.\"\n\n     Holmes looked thoughtful and remained in silence for some moments.\n\n     \"Well, Watson, there is this to be said for your theory. Ronder was a\n     man of many enemies. Edmunds told me that in his cups he was\n     horrible. A huge bully of a man, he cursed and slashed at everyone\n     who came in his way. I expect those cries about a monster, of which\n     our visitor has spoken, were nocturnal reminiscences of the dear\n     departed. However, our speculations are futile until we have all the\n     facts. There is a cold partridge on the sideboard, Watson, and a\n     bottle of Montrachet. Let us renew our energies before we make a\n     fresh call upon them.\"\n\n     When our hansom deposited us at the house of Mrs. Merrilow, we found\n     that plump lady blocking up the open door of her humble but retired\n######################\nOutput:",

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nTHE ADVENTURE OF THE VEILED LODGER\\n\\n                               Arthur Conan Doyle\\n\\n     When one considers that Mr. Sherlock Holmes was in active practice\\n     for twenty-three years, and that during seventeen of these I was\\n     allowed to cooperate with him and to keep notes of his doings, it\\n     will be clear that I have a mass of material at my command. The\\n     problem has always been not to find but to choose. There is the long\\n     row of year-books which fill a shelf, and there are the\\n     dispatch-cases filled with documents, a perfect quarry for the\\n     student not only of crime but of the social and official scandals of\\n     the late Victorian era. Concerning these latter, I may say that the\\n     writers of agonized letters, who beg that the honour of their\\n     families or the reputation of famous forebears may not be touched,\\n     have nothing to fear. The discretion and high sense of professional\\n     honour which have always distinguished my friend are still at work in\\n     the choice of these memoirs, and no confidence will be abused. I\\n     deprecate, however, in the strongest way the attempts which have been\\n     made lately to get at and to destroy these papers. The source of\\n     these outrages is known, and if they are repeated I have Mr. Holmes's\\n     authority for saying that the whole story concerning the politician,\\n     the lighthouse, and the trained cormorant will be given to the\\n     public. There is at least one reader who will understand.\\n\\n     It is not reasonable to suppose that every one of these cases gave\\n     Holmes the opportunity of showing those curious gifts of instinct and\\n     observation which I have endeavoured to set forth in these memoirs.\\n     Sometimes he had with much effort to pick the fruit, sometimes it\\n     fell easily into his lap. But the most terrible human tragedies were\\n     often involved in those cases which brought him the fewest personal\\n     opportunities, and it is one of these which I now desire to record.\\n     In telling it, I have made a slight change of name and place, but\\n     otherwise the facts are as stated.\\n\\n     One forenoon--it was late in 1896--I received a hurried note from\\n     Holmes asking for my attendance. When I arrived I found him seated in\\n     a smoke-laden atmosphere, with an elderly, motherly woman of the\\n     buxom landlady type in the corresponding chair in front of him.\\n\\n     \\\"This is Mrs. Merrilow, of South Brixton,\\\" said my friend with a wave\\n     of the hand. \\\"Mrs. Merrilow does not object to tobacco, Watson, if\\n     you wish to indulge your filthy habits. Mrs. Merrilow has an\\n     interesting story to tell which may well lead to further developments\\n     in which your presence may be useful.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Anything I can do--\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You will understand, Mrs. Merrilow, that if I come to Mrs. Ronder I\\n     should prefer to have a witness. You will make her understand that\\n     before we arrive.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Lord bless you, Mr. Holmes,\\\" said our visitor, \\\"she is that anxious\\n     to see you that you might bring the whole parish at your heels!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Then we shall come early in the afternoon. Let us see that we have\\n     our facts correct before we start. If we go over them it will help\\n     Dr. Watson to understand the situation. You say that Mrs. Ronder has\\n     been your lodger for seven years and that you have only once seen her\\n     face.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And I wish to God I had not!\\\" said Mrs. Merrilow.\\n\\n     \\\"It was, I understand, terribly mutilated.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Well, Mr. Holmes, you would hardly say it was a face at all. That's\\n     how it looked. Our milkman got a glimpse of her once peeping out of\\n     the upper window, and he dropped his tin and the milk all over the\\n     front garden. That is the kind of face it is. When I saw her--I\\n     happened on her unawares--she covered up quick, and then she said,\\n     'Now, Mrs. Merrilow, you know at last why it is that I never raise my\\n     veil.'\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Do you know anything about her history?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Nothing at all.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Did she give references when she came?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"No, sir, but she gave hard cash, and plenty of it. A quarter's rent\\n     right down on the table in advance and no arguing about terms. In\\n     these times a poor woman like me can't afford to turn down a chance\\n     like that.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Did she give any reason for choosing your house?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Mine stands well back from the road and is more private than most.\\n     Then, again, I only take the one, and I have no family of my own. I\\n     reckon she had tried others and found that mine suited her best. It's\\n     privacy she is after, and she is ready to pay for it.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You say that she never showed her face from first to last save on\\n     the one accidental occasion. Well, it is a very remarkable story,\\n     most remarkable, and I don't wonder that you want it examined.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I don't, Mr. Holmes. I am quite satisfied so long as I get my rent.\\n     You could not have a quieter lodger, or one who gives less trouble.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Then what has brought matters to a head?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Her health, Mr. Holmes. She seems to be wasting away.

However, our speculations are futile until we have all the\\n     facts. There is a cold partridge on the sideboard, Watson, and a\\n     bottle of Montrachet. Let us renew our energies before we make a\\n     fresh call upon them.\\\"\\n\\n     When our hansom deposited us at the house of Mrs. Merrilow, we found\\n     that plump lady blocking up the open door of her humble but retired\\n     abode. It was very clear that her chief preoccupation was lest she\\n     should lose a valuable lodger, and she implored us, before showing us\\n     up, to say and do nothing which could lead to so undesirable an end.\\n     Then, having reassured her, we followed her up the straight, badly\\n     carpeted staircase and were shown into the room of the mysterious\\n     lodger.\\n\\n     It was a close, musty, ill-ventilated place, as might be expected,\\n     since its inmate seldom left it. From keeping beasts in a cage, the\\n     woman seemed, by some retribution of fate, to have become herself a\\n     beast in a cage. She sat now in a broken armchair in the shadowy\\n     corner of the room. Long years of inaction had coarsened the lines of\\n     her figure, but at some period it must have been beautiful, and was\\n     still full and voluptuous. A thick dark veil covered her face, but it\\n     was cut off close at her upper lip and disclosed a perfectly shaped\\n     mouth and a delicately rounded chin. I could well conceive that she\\n     had indeed been a very remarkable woman. Her voice, too, was well\\n     modulated and pleasing.\\n\\n     \\\"My name is not unfamiliar to you, Mr. Holmes,\\\" said she. \\\"I thought\\n     that it would bring you.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That is so, madam, though I do not know how you are aware that I was\\n     interested in your case.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I learned it when I had recovered my health and was examined by Mr.\\n     Edmunds, the county detective. I fear I lied to him. Perhaps it would\\n     have been wiser had I told the truth.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"It is usually wiser to tell the truth. But why did you lie to him?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Because the fate of someone else depended upon it. I know that he\\n     was a very worthless being, and yet I would not have his destruction\\n     upon my conscience. We had been so close--so close!\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"But has this impediment been removed?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Yes, sir. The person that I allude to is dead.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Then why should you not now tell the police anything you know?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Because there is another person to be considered. That other person\\n     is myself. I could not stand the scandal and publicity which would\\n     come from a police examination. I have not long to live, but I wish\\n     to die undisturbed. And yet I wanted to find one man of judgment to\\n     whom I could tell my terrible story, so that when I am gone all might\\n     be understood.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"You compliment me, madam. At the same time, I am a responsible\\n     person. I do not promise you that when you have spoken I may not\\n     myself think it my duty to refer the case to the police.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I think not, Mr. Holmes. I know your character and methods too well,\\n     for I have followed your work for some years. Reading is the only\\n     pleasure which fate has left me, and I miss little which passes in\\n     the world. But in any case, I will take my chance of the use which\\n     you may make of my tragedy. It will ease my mind to tell it.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"My friend and I would be glad to hear it.\\\"\\n\\n     The woman rose and took from a drawer the photograph of a man. He was\\n     clearly a professional acrobat, a man of magnificent physique, taken\\n     with his huge arms folded across his swollen chest and a smile\\n     breaking from under his heavy moustache--the self-satisfied smile of\\n     the man of many conquests.\\n\\n     \\\"That is Leonardo,\\\" she said.\\n\\n     \\\"Leonardo, the strong man, who gave evidence?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"The same. And this--this is my husband.\\\"\\n\\n     It was a dreadful face--a human pig, or rather a human wild boar, for\\n     it was formidable in its bestiality. One could imagine that vile\\n     mouth champing and foaming in its rage, and one could conceive those\\n     small, vicious eyes darting pure malignancy as they looked forth upon\\n     the world. Ruffian, bully, beast--it was all written on that\\n     heavy-jowled face.\\n\\n     \\\"Those two pictures will help you, gentlemen, to understand the\\n     story. I was a poor circus girl brought up on the sawdust, and doing\\n     springs through the hoop before I was ten. When I became a woman this\\n     man loved me, if such lust as his can be called love, and in an evil\\n     moment I became his wife. From that day I was in hell, and he the\\n     devil who tormented me. There was no one in the show who did not know\\n     of his treatment. He deserted me for others. He tied me down and\\n     lashed me with his riding-whip when I complained. They all pitied me\\n     and they all loathed him, but what could they do? They feared him,\\n     one and all.

Well, it is a very remarkable story,\\n     most remarkable, and I don't wonder that you want it examined.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I don't, Mr. Holmes. I am quite satisfied so long as I get my rent.\\n     You could not have a quieter lodger, or one who gives less trouble.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Then what has brought matters to a head?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Her health, Mr. Holmes. She seems to be wasting away. And there's\\n     something terrible on her mind. 'Murder!' she cries. 'Murder!' And\\n     once I heard her: 'You cruel beast! You monster!' she cried. It was\\n     in the night, and it fair rang through the house and sent the shivers\\n     through me. So I went to her in the morning. 'Mrs. Ronder,' I says,\\n     'if you have anything that is troubling your soul, there's the\\n     clergy,' I says, 'and there's the police. Between them you should get\\n     some help.' 'For God's sake, not the police!' says she, 'and the\\n     clergy can't change what is past. And yet,' she says, 'it would ease\\n     my mind if someone knew the truth before I died.' 'Well,' says I, 'if\\n     you won't have the regulars, there is this detective man what we read\\n     about'--beggin' your pardon, Mr. Holmes. And she, she fair jumped at\\n     it. 'That's the man,' says she. 'I wonder I never thought of it\\n     before. Bring him here, Mrs. Merrilow, and if he won't come, tell him\\n     I am the wife of Ronder's wild beast show. Say that, and give him the\\n     name Abbas Parva. Here it is as she wrote it, Abbas Parva. 'That will\\n     bring him if he's the man I think he is.'\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And it will, too,\\\" remarked Holmes. \\\"Very good, Mrs. Merrilow. I\\n     should like to have a little chat with Dr. Watson. That will carry us\\n     till lunch-time. About three o'clock you may expect to see us at your\\n     house in Brixton.\\\"\\n\\n     Our visitor had no sooner waddled out of the room--no other verb can\\n     describe Mrs. Merrilow's method of progression--than Sherlock Holmes\\n     threw himself with fierce energy upon the pile of commonplace books\\n     in the corner. For a few minutes there was a constant swish of the\\n     leaves, and then with a grunt of satisfaction he came upon what he\\n     sought. So excited was he that he did not rise, but sat upon the\\n     floor like some strange Buddha, with crossed legs, the huge books all\\n     round him, and one open upon his knees.\\n\\n     \\\"The case worried me at the time, Watson. Here are my marginal notes\\n     to prove it. I confess that I could make nothing of it. And yet I was\\n     convinced that the coroner was wrong. Have you no recollection of the\\n     Abbas Parva tragedy?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"None, Holmes.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And yet you were with me then. But certainly my own impression was\\n     very superficial. For there was nothing to go by, and none of the\\n     parties had engaged my services. Perhaps you would care to read the\\n     papers?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Could you not give me the points?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"That is very easily done. It will probably come back to your memory\\n     as I talk. Ronder, of course, was a household word. He was the rival\\n     of Wombwell, and of Sanger, one of the greatest showmen of his day.\\n     There is evidence, however, that he took to drink, and that both he\\n     and his show were on the down grade at the time of the great tragedy.\\n     The caravan had halted for the night at Abbas Parva, which is a small\\n     village in Berkshire, when this horror occurred. They were on their\\n     way to Wimbledon, travelling by road, and they were simply camping\\n     and not exhibiting, as the place is so small a one that it would not\\n     have paid them to open.\\n\\n     \\\"They had among their exhibits a very fine North African lion. Sahara\\n     King was its name, and it was the habit, both of Ronder and his wife,\\n     to give exhibitions inside its cage. Here, you see, is a photograph\\n     of the performance by which you will perceive that Ronder was a huge\\n     porcine person and that his wife was a very magnificent woman. It was\\n     deposed at the inquest that there had been some signs that the lion\\n     was dangerous, but, as usual, familiarity begat contempt, and no\\n     notice was taken of the fact.\\n\\n     \\\"It was usual for either Ronder or his wife to feed the lion at\\n     night. Sometimes one went, sometimes both, but they never allowed\\n     anyone else to do it, for they believed that so long as they were the\\n     food-carriers he would regard them as benefactors and would never\\n     molest them.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nyears ago, they both\\n     went, and a very terrible happening followed, the details of which\\n     have never been made clear.\\n\\n     \\\"It seems that the whole camp was roused near midnight by the roars\\n     of the animal and the screams of the woman. The different grooms and\\n     employees rushed from their tents, carrying lanterns, and by their\\n     light an awful sight was revealed. Ronder lay, with the back of his\\n     head crushed in and deep claw-marks across his scalp, some ten yards\\n     from the cage, which was open. Close to the door of the cage lay Mrs.\\n     Ronder upon her back, with the creature squatting and snarling above\\n     her. It had torn her face in such a fashion that it was never thought\\n     that she could live. Several of the circus men, headed by Leonardo,\\n     the strong man, and Griggs, the clown, drove the creature off with\\n     poles, upon which it sprang back into the cage and was at once locked\\n     in. How it had got loose was a mystery. It was conjectured that the\\n     pair intended to enter the cage, but that when the door was loosed\\n     the creature bounded out upon them. There was no other point of\\n     interest in the evidence save that the woman in a delirium of agony\\n     kept screaming, 'Coward! Coward!' as she was carried back to the van\\n     in which they lived. It was six months before she was fit to give\\n     evidence, but the inquest was duly held, with the obvious verdict of\\n     death from misadventure.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What alternative could be conceived?\\\" said I.\\n\\n     \\\"You may well say so. And yet there were one or two points which\\n     worried young Edmunds, of the Berkshire Constabulary. A smart lad\\n     that! He was sent later to Allahabad. That was how I came into the\\n     matter, for he dropped in and smoked a pipe or two over it.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"A thin, yellow-haired man?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Exactly. I was sure you would pick up the trail presently.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"But what worried him?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Well, we were both worried. It was so deucedly difficult to\\n     reconstruct the affair. Look at it from the lion's point of view. He\\n     is liberated. What does he do? He takes half a dozen bounds forward,\\n     which brings him to Ronder. Ronder turns to fly--the claw-marks were\\n     on the back of his head--but the lion strikes him down. Then, instead\\n     of bounding on and escaping, he returns to the woman, who was close\\n     to the cage, and he knocks her over and chews her face up. Then,\\n     again, those cries of hers would seem to imply that her husband had\\n     in some way failed her. What could the poor devil have done to help\\n     her? You see the difficulty?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Quite.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And then there was another thing. It comes back to me now as I think\\n     it over. There was some evidence that just at the time the lion\\n     roared and the woman screamed, a man began shouting in terror.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"This man Ronder, no doubt.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Well, if his skull was smashed in you would hardly expect to hear\\n     from him again. There were at least two witnesses who spoke of the\\n     cries of a man being mingled with those of a woman.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I should think the whole camp was crying out by then. As to the\\n     other points, I think I could suggest a solution.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"I should be glad to consider it.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"The two were together, ten yards from the cage, when the lion got\\n     loose. The man turned and was struck down. The woman conceived the\\n     idea of getting into the cage and shutting the door. It was her only\\n     refuge. She made for it, and just as she reached it the beast bounded\\n     after her and knocked her over. She was angry with her husband for\\n     having encouraged the beast's rage by turning. If they had faced it\\n     they might have cowed it. Hence her cries of 'Coward!'\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Brilliant, Watson! Only one flaw in your diamond.\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"What is the flaw, Holmes?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"If they were both ten paces from the cage, how came the beast to get\\n     loose?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Is it possible that they had some enemy who loosed it?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"And why should it attack them savagely when it was in the habit of\\n     playing with them, and doing tricks with them inside the cage?\\\"\\n\\n     \\\"Possibly the same enemy had done something to enrage it.\\\"\\n\\n     Holmes looked thoughtful and remained in silence for some moments.\\n\\n     \\\"Well, Watson, there is this to be said for your theory. Ronder was a\\n     man of many enemies. Edmunds told me that in his cups he was\\n     horrible. A huge bully of a man, he cursed and slashed at everyone\\n     who came in his way. I expect those cries about a monster, of which\\n     our visitor has spoken, were nocturnal reminiscences of the dear\\n     departed. However, our speculations are futile until we have all the\\n     facts. There is a cold partridge on the sideboard, Watson, and a\\n     bottle of Montrachet.

He had\n     left me under the beast's claws, he had deserted me in my need, and\n     yet I could not bring myself to give him to the gallows. For myself,\n     I cared nothing what became of me. What could be more dreadful than\n     my actual life? But I stood between Leonardo and his fate.\"\n\n     \"And he is dead?\"\n\n     \"He was drowned last month when bathing near Margate.

Despite enduring torment, she found love with Leonardo, a strongman, who ultimately devised a plan to kill her husband to free her from her suffering. They created a five-clawed club to make it seem like Ronder's death was caused by the lion. However, during the chaos that followed, Eugenia was attacked by the lion, leading to her disfigurement. The story explores themes of love, betrayal, and trauma, as Eugenia seeks to disclose her tragic past to Sherlock Holmes, who expresses sympathy for her plight.\n\n### References\n1.

It is also used in soap making, and in manufacturing cosmetics and lubricants, olein, stearin and their salts. Kernels are also eaten raw, roasted or sweetened. They are rich in protein and vitamins A, B and members of the B2 group. The cake can be used for manufacturing artificial fibre. The haulms are fed (green, dried or silaged) to livestock. Groundnut shell is used as fuel for manufacturing coarse boards, cork substitutes etc. Groundnut is also of value as a rotation crop. The production are concentrated in the four states of Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Orissa have irrigated areas.\n\nRequirement\nClimate\nThe crop can be grown successfully in places receiving a minimum rainfall of 500mm and a maximum rainfall of 1,250mm. The rainfall should be distributed well during the flowering and pegging of the crop. The groundnut cannot stand frost, long and severe drought or water stagnation.\n\nSoil\nThe crop does best on sandy loam and loamy soils and in black soils with good drainage. Heavy and stiff clays are unsuitable for groundnut cultivation as the pod development is hampered in these soils.\n\nVarieties\nBunch type\n'Junagadh-II', 'TMV-2', 'Pol-2', 'AK 12-24', 'Kopergaon-3', 'KG-61-240' (Jyothi).\n\nSemi-spreading type\n'TMV-6', 'TMV-8','Kopergaon-1', 'C-501'.\n\nSpreading type\n'Punjab-I', 'GAUG-10','Kadiri-71.1', TMV-1', 'TMV-3', 'S-230', 'Karad4-11'\n\nCultivation\nFor a kharif crop, with the onset of rains in May-June, the field is given two ploughing and the soil is pulverized well to obtain a good tilth. Harrows or tiller can be used for cultivation. If a field is infested with white grubs, chemicals, such as Heptachlor or Chlordane, are drilled at the rate of 25kg per ha. before final harrowing. For the irrigated crop, beds of convenient size may be made, depending upon the topography of the land, the nature of the irrigation source and the mode of lifting water.\n\nSowing\nGroundnut is raised mostly as a rainfed kharif crop, being sown from May to June, depending on the monsoon rains. It is sown as late as August or early September. As an irrigated crop it is grown to limited extent between January and March and between in May and July. Well-filled kernels should be selected and treated with 5g of Thiram or 3g of Captan per kg of kernels. The quantity of well-developed seeds required per hectare about 110 kg for semi spreading and spreading varieties and 120kg for the bunch varieties. The kharif crop is sown with a seed drill or with a suitable planter at a depth of 8-10 cm. for semi spreading and spreading varieties, the spacing between at he adjacent rows varies for m30-60cm and within the row from 10-15cm. For the rainfed bunch groundnut the inter-row spacing vary between 20 and 30cm and the intra-row spacing between 10 and 20cm.\n\nFertilizer\nFertilizer recommended for rainfed crop is 6.25 tonnes farmyard manure and 10-25kg nitrogen (N), 20-40kg phosphorus (P2O5) and 20-40kg potash (K2O) per hectare. For irrigated crop 12.5 tonnes farmyard manure and 20-40kg nitrogen (N), 40-90kg phosphorus (P2O5) and 20-40kg potash (K2O) per hectare. The application of nitrogen (N) in two equal splits doses, one before sowing and the other 30 days after sowing. The application of a culture of Rhizobium as seed treatment is beneficial in increasing nodulation and nitrogen fixation. The application of gypsum at 500kg per ha at the pegging stage will enhance pod formation.\n\nIrrigation\nThe kharif crop is caught in a long spell of drought, especially at the pod-formation stage, supplemental irrigation is given. For the irrigated groundnut, the frequency of irrigation depends on the soil texture, and the interval between irrigation ranges from 8-12 days. The peg-formation stage is critical.\n\nIntercultural operations\nFor controlling weeds, and also to keep the soil in a friable condition, the crop should generally receive a hand-weeding and one or two hoeings, with bullock-drawn implements, the first about three weeks after sowing and the second and the third about a fortnight and a month later. No interculture would be done after the pegs have commenced going underground. Earthing up can be done in the case of bunch and semi-spreading types for facilitate the maximum penetration of the pegs into the soil. Weeds can also be controlled effectively with Lasso or Tok-E-25 weedicide at the rate of 5 litres in 500 litres of water per hectare as a pre-emergence soil spray within two days of sowing groundnut.\n\nPlant protection\nPest Leaf-miner\nCaterpillars mine the tender leaves and later fold the adjacent leaves to feed within. Pest active during July to December; drought, with occasional showers\n######################\nOutput:",

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nIntroduction:\\nGroundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is important oilseed crop and oil content of the seed varies from 44-50%, depending on the varieties and agronomic conditions. It is also used in soap making, and in manufacturing cosmetics and lubricants, olein, stearin and their salts. Kernels are also eaten raw, roasted or sweetened. They are rich in protein and vitamins A, B and members of the B2 group. The cake can be used for manufacturing artificial fibre. The haulms are fed (green, dried or silaged) to livestock. Groundnut shell is used as fuel for manufacturing coarse boards, cork substitutes etc. Groundnut is also of value as a rotation crop. The production are concentrated in the four states of Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Orissa have irrigated areas.\\n\\nRequirement\\nClimate\\nThe crop can be grown successfully in places receiving a minimum rainfall of 500mm and a maximum rainfall of 1,250mm. The rainfall should be distributed well during the flowering and pegging of the crop. The groundnut cannot stand frost, long and severe drought or water stagnation.\\n\\nSoil\\nThe crop does best on sandy loam and loamy soils and in black soils with good drainage. Heavy and stiff clays are unsuitable for groundnut cultivation as the pod development is hampered in these soils.\\n\\nVarieties\\nBunch type\\n'Junagadh-II', 'TMV-2', 'Pol-2', 'AK 12-24', 'Kopergaon-3', 'KG-61-240' (Jyothi).\\n\\nSemi-spreading type\\n'TMV-6', 'TMV-8','Kopergaon-1', 'C-501'.\\n\\nSpreading type\\n'Punjab-I', 'GAUG-10','Kadiri-71.1', TMV-1', 'TMV-3', 'S-230', 'Karad4-11'\\n\\nCultivation\\nFor a kharif crop, with the onset of rains in May-June, the field is given two ploughing and the soil is pulverized well to obtain a good tilth. Harrows or tiller can be used for cultivation. If a field is infested with white grubs, chemicals, such as Heptachlor or Chlordane, are drilled at the rate of 25kg per ha. before final harrowing. For the irrigated crop, beds of convenient size may be made, depending upon the topography of the land, the nature of the irrigation source and the mode of lifting water.\\n\\nSowing\\nGroundnut is raised mostly as a rainfed kharif crop, being sown from May to June, depending on the monsoon rains. It is sown as late as August or early September. As an irrigated crop it is grown to limited extent between January and March and between in May and July. Well-filled kernels should be selected and treated with 5g of Thiram or 3g of Captan per kg of kernels. The quantity of well-developed seeds required per hectare about 110 kg for semi spreading and spreading varieties and 120kg for the bunch varieties. The kharif crop is sown with a seed drill or with a suitable planter at a depth of 8-10 cm. for semi spreading and spreading varieties, the spacing between at he adjacent rows varies for m30-60cm and within the row from 10-15cm. For the rainfed bunch groundnut the inter-row spacing vary between 20 and 30cm and the intra-row spacing between 10 and 20cm.\\n\\nFertilizer\\nFertilizer recommended for rainfed crop is 6.25 tonnes farmyard manure and 10-25kg nitrogen (N), 20-40kg phosphorus (P2O5) and 20-40kg potash (K2O) per hectare. For irrigated crop 12.5 tonnes farmyard manure and 20-40kg nitrogen (N), 40-90kg phosphorus (P2O5) and 20-40kg potash (K2O) per hectare. The application of nitrogen (N) in two equal splits doses, one before sowing and the other 30 days after sowing. The application of a culture of Rhizobium as seed treatment is beneficial in increasing nodulation and nitrogen fixation. The application of gypsum at 500kg per ha at the pegging stage will enhance pod formation.\\n\\nIrrigation\\nThe kharif crop is caught in a long spell of drought, especially at the pod-formation stage, supplemental irrigation is given. For the irrigated groundnut, the frequency of irrigation depends on the soil texture, and the interval between irrigation ranges from 8-12 days. The peg-formation stage is critical.\\n\\nIntercultural operations\\nFor controlling weeds, and also to keep the soil in a friable condition, the crop should generally receive a hand-weeding and one or two hoeings, with bullock-drawn implements, the first about three weeks after sowing and the second and the third about a fortnight and a month later. No interculture would be done after the pegs have commenced going underground. Earthing up can be done in the case of bunch and semi-spreading types for facilitate the maximum penetration of the pegs into the soil. Weeds can also be controlled effectively with Lasso or Tok-E-25 weedicide at the rate of 5 litres in 500 litres of water per hectare as a pre-emergence soil spray within two days of sowing groundnut.\\n\\nPlant protection\\nPest Leaf-miner\\nCaterpillars mine the tender leaves and later fold the adjacent leaves to feed within. Pest active during July to December; drought, with occasional showers\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important oilseed crop known for its oil content of 44-50%, used in various industries including soap making, cosmetics, and as feed for livestock.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Gujarat\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Gujarat is one of the four states in India where groundnut production is concentrated.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Andhra Pradesh\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Andhra Pradesh is one of the four states in India where groundnut production is concentrated.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tamil Nadu\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Tamil Nadu is one of the four states in India where groundnut production is concentrated.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Karnataka\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Karnataka is one of the four states in India where groundnut production is concentrated.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Orissa\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"Orissa is mentioned as a state with irrigated areas suitable for groundnut cultivation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Heptachlor\\\"<|>\\\"chemical\\\"<|>\\\"Heptachlor is a chemical used against white grubs in groundnut cultivation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Chlordane\\\"<|>\\\"chemical\\\"<|>\\\"Chlordane is a chemical used against white grubs in groundnut cultivation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Rhizobium\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Rhizobium is a culture beneficial for increasing nodulation and nitrogen fixation in groundnut plants.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Lasso\\\"<|>\\\"chemical\\\"<|>\\\"Lasso is a weedicide used for controlling weeds in groundnut cultivation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Tok-E-25\\\"<|>\\\"chemical\\\"<|>\\\"Tok-E-25 is a weedicide used for controlling weeds in groundnut cultivation.\\\")##\\n\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut\\\"<|>\\\"Gujarat\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut is an important crop produced in Gujarat, contributing to its agricultural economy.\\\"<|>\\\"crops, agriculture\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut\\\"<|>\\\"Andhra Pradesh\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut is an important crop produced in Andhra Pradesh, contributing to its agricultural economy.\\\"<|>\\\"crops, agriculture\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut\\\"<|>\\\"Tamil Nadu\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut is an important crop produced in Tamil Nadu, contributing to its agricultural economy.\\\"<|>\\\"crops, agriculture\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut\\\"<|>\\\"Karnataka\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut is an important crop produced in Karnataka, contributing to its agricultural economy.\\\"<|>\\\"crops, agriculture\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut\\\"<|>\\\"Orissa\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut has irrigated areas in Orissa suitable for its cultivation.\\\"<|>\\\"crops, agriculture\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut\\\"<|>\\\"Heptachlor\\\"<|>\\\"Heptachlor is used in the cultivation of groundnut to manage pests.\\\"<|>\\\"pest management, cultivation practices\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut\\\"<|>\\\"Chlordane\\\"<|>\\\"Chlordane is used in the cultivation of groundnut to manage pests.\\\"<|>\\\"pest management, cultivation practices\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut\\\"<|>\\\"Rhizobium\\\"<|>\\\"The application of Rhizobium increases nodulation and benefits groundnut cultivation.\\\"<|>\\\"biological treatment, enhancement\\\"<|>10)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut\\\"<|>\\\"Lasso\\\"<|>\\\"Lasso is used in groundnut cultivation for controlling weeds, aiding crop health.\\\"<|>\\\"weed control, agricultural practices\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Groundnut\\\"<|>\\\"Tok-E-25\\\"<|>\\\"Tok-E-25 is used in groundnut cultivation for controlling weeds, aiding crop health.\\\"<|>\\\"weed control, agricultural practices\\\"<|>9)##\\n\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"groundnut cultivation, agricultural practices, pest management, soil quality, varieties\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

The crop requires about 60-65 cm annual rainfall drought at flowering or just before flowering results in flower and pod drops, while rains during maturity impairs the grain quality of soyabean. harmful. The best soil type is sandy loam having good organic matter content.\n\nSoyabean - Crop Cultivation Guidence\nVarieties\nMonetta, M.A.C.S.-13, M.A.C.S.-57, M.A.C.S.-58, M.A.C.S-124, P.K. 472, J.S.-80-21, J.S. 335\n\nSowing\nTwo cropping seasons of soybean Kharif and spring.\nIn case of Kharif season most common time of sowing is onset of monsoon or last week of June to first week of Jully while spring sowing is done between 15th of February and 15th of March.\n\nMethod of sowing - Line sowing by seed drill followed as it needs less seeds/ha, weeding and hoeing may be done conveniently\n\nSeed treatment- Seeds are treated with rhizobium culture.\n\nSpacing- A 45-60 cm X 2.5 cm spacing is good for Kharif crop and 30-45 X 2.5 cm during spring season.\n\nSeedling depth- 2-3 cm in heavy soils and 3-4 cm light soils.\n\nSeed rate- Soyabean grown for grain purpose needs about 20-30 kg seed/ha but for fodder crop needs about 70-75 kg/ha during Kharif season and 100-120 kg/ha during spring.\n\nFertilizers-\nSoyabean gives higher positive response to applied nitrogen over symbiotically fixed atmospheric nitrogen through its roots alone which proves that nitrogen fixed by soyabean roots is not enough for its and development. Crop is supplied with 10-15% of total nitrogen requirement\n\nApplication of 25-30 C.L.FYM at the time of sowing proved better results.50 Kg N + 100 Kg P2O5, 20 kg sulphur per ha. Also 25 Kg Zinc sulphate and 10 Kg Borax should be applied.\n\nWater requirement\nIn case of Kharif crop irrigation is not needed and it is grown rainfed. However during summer the crop can be grown only under assured irrigation and it needs about 5-6 irrigations. The crop should be irrigated at the following critical growth stages to minimize water.\n1. Sprouting stage\n2. Flowering pod initiation and bean filling stages are important from yield point of view\n\nCultivation Practices\nAt the time of sowing one deep ploughing two harrowings should be given tomaintain optimum moisture at sowing.\n\nAfter care\nKeep plot weed free upto 40 days by one or two hoeings, two weedings upto 40 days. Herbicides such as Toke 25, 1.5 to 2 Kg/ha pre-emergence before sowing controls the weeds.\n\nCrop Rotation and inter cropping\nMixed with maize, sesamum etc. Inter cropping with Tur, Cotton, drilled paddy sorghum, cotton, sugarcane. It can be rotated with wheat, potato, gram, tobacco\n\nHarvesting\nCrop harvested at proper stage by usual method, threshing machine.\nSigns of maturity- Dropping of leaves, leaves turn yellow, moisture content of seed 15%\n\nYield\n-Average yield 25g/ha\n######################\nOutput:",

temperature. The crop requires about 60-65 cm annual rainfall drought at flowering or just before flowering results in flower and pod drops, while rains during maturity impairs the grain quality of soyabean. harmful. The best soil type is sandy loam having good organic matter content.\\n\\nSoyabean - Crop Cultivation Guidence\\nVarieties\\nMonetta, M.A.C.S.-13, M.A.C.S.-57, M.A.C.S.-58, M.A.C.S-124, P.K. 472, J.S.-80-21, J.S. 335\\n\\nSowing\\nTwo cropping seasons of soybean Kharif and spring.\\nIn case of Kharif season most common time of sowing is onset of monsoon or last week of June to first week of Jully while spring sowing is done between 15th of February and 15th of March.\\n\\nMethod of sowing - Line sowing by seed drill followed as it needs less seeds/ha, weeding and hoeing may be done conveniently\\n\\nSeed treatment- Seeds are treated with rhizobium culture.\\n\\nSpacing- A 45-60 cm X 2.5 cm spacing is good for Kharif crop and 30-45 X 2.5 cm during spring season.\\n\\nSeedling depth- 2-3 cm in heavy soils and 3-4 cm light soils.\\n\\nSeed rate- Soyabean grown for grain purpose needs about 20-30 kg seed/ha but for fodder crop needs about 70-75 kg/ha during Kharif season and 100-120 kg/ha during spring.\\n\\nFertilizers-\\nSoyabean gives higher positive response to applied nitrogen over symbiotically fixed atmospheric nitrogen through its roots alone which proves that nitrogen fixed by soyabean roots is not enough for its and development. Crop is supplied with 10-15% of total nitrogen requirement\\n\\nApplication of 25-30 C.L.FYM at the time of sowing proved better results.50 Kg N + 100 Kg P2O5, 20 kg sulphur per ha. Also 25 Kg Zinc sulphate and 10 Kg Borax should be applied.\\n\\nWater requirement\\nIn case of Kharif crop irrigation is not needed and it is grown rainfed. However during summer the crop can be grown only under assured irrigation and it needs about 5-6 irrigations. The crop should be irrigated at the following critical growth stages to minimize water.\\n1. Sprouting stage\\n2. Flowering pod initiation and bean filling stages are important from yield point of view\\n\\nCultivation Practices\\nAt the time of sowing one deep ploughing two harrowings should be given tomaintain optimum moisture at sowing.\\n\\nAfter care\\nKeep plot weed free upto 40 days by one or two hoeings, two weedings upto 40 days. Herbicides such as Toke 25, 1.5 to 2 Kg/ha pre-emergence before sowing controls the weeds.\\n\\nCrop Rotation and inter cropping\\nMixed with maize, sesamum etc. Inter cropping with Tur, Cotton, drilled paddy sorghum, cotton, sugarcane. It can be rotated with wheat, potato, gram, tobacco\\n\\nHarvesting\\nCrop harvested at proper stage by usual method, threshing machine.\\nSigns of maturity- Dropping of leaves, leaves turn yellow,

The sugarcane harvest is timed and coordinated undertaking to allow for maximum utilization of the mill's grinding capacity. At present the harvesting and supply of sugarcane is done by the farmers after receiving the cutting orders from the factory authorities. The cutting orders are issued depending upon the date of planting as found in the records and agreement between the farmers and factory. This system will not hold good, as uniform maturity of the cane crop can’t be controlled even by planting early maturing varieties in the early season. In a typical harvesting unit, three or four harvesters operate in tandem with six to eight tractors and strings of wagons. The huge machines contain rotating knives, which cut the sugarcane at the base of the stalk. The cane tops are also cut off by rotating knives and the excess foliage is removed by giant extraction fans. As the sugarcane passes through the harvester, it is cut into 12-inch lengths called billets and then put into in-field wagons. The sugarcane is then hauled to near-by transfer stations and loaded into semi-trailers for delivery.\n\nYield\nThe average yield of a 11 to 12 month-old plant crop under commercial cultivation is 100 tonnes per hectare in case of suru, 170 tonnes per hectare for Adsali and 120 tonnes per hectare in case of pre seasonal sugarcane.\n######################\nOutput:",

The final earthing-up should be completed before the monsoon rains, and should generally synchronize with the application of the final dose of fertilizer. This helps to keep down the weeds.\n\nTying of cane\nIt is very desirable to tie up the canes so that they may not sway during the winds, and lodge. The best way to do the tying is to bring together the stalks from adjacent rows and tie them together with their own trash and old leaves. In many places cane is tied at two or three levels with twists of cane trash, the twistline going from one end of the row to the other; sometimes the stalks are further propped up with bamboos.\n\nPlant protection\nPest\nTermites\nTermites are attack planted sugarcane setts, usually from the cut ends or eyebuds, but in severe cases internode as well; after germination, the roots are attacked and pest ascends in the canes, eating all their contents and filling the galleries with earth; leaves dry up and the plants die; more active in sandy soils and in drier tracts.\n\nControl\nUse only well-rotted manure, mix thoroughly 5% Aldrin or Chlordane dust with the soil; if the standing crop is attacked, apply Aldrin E.C. at 3kg a.i/ha diluted with 2,000 litres of water as near the roots as possible.\n\nEarly shoot-borer\nCausing dead-hearts which can be easily pulled out; the maximum activity is observed during April to August; responsible for serious losses in tonnage and sugar recovery.\nControl\nPractice cleans cultivation; plant healthy setts; give two light stage of the crop; avoid ratooning; systematically collect and destroy egg masses; remove dead-hearts and do deep harvesting.\n\nInternode borer\nNewly hatched caterpillars scrape the leaf spindle; later, they bore into the tender cane tops; the growing-point is damaged and results in a dead-heart; active from July till harvest; the pest causes more loss in tonnage than in juice quality.\n\nControl\nBurn all trash after harvest; Practice clean cultivation; collect and destroy egg masses and larvae during early stages of crop.\n\nDisease\nRed rot\nIt is a fungal disease. The symptoms of the disease will appear when the crop is about six months old. At the initial stage, drying of top leaves can be seen. The leaf starts withering and drooping almost all shoots in a clump starts drying one by one. Red lesions with straw coloured centres develop on the midrib of leaves.\nControl\nUproot and destroy all the clumps as soon as symptoms appear. Avoid ratooning. Use disease free and heat-treated setts for planting. After harvest, collect and burn the plant debris. Grow resistant varieties like CO-7706, CO-86032 and tolerant varieties are CO-8021 and CO-62175.\nFollow crop rotation. Dip the setts in systemic fungicide Benomyl (0.1%) solution for at least 30 minutes before planting.\n\nWhip smut\nIt is fungal disease. The symptoms can be seen on the crop from the time it is one month old upto harvesting time. The affected young plants show excessive tillering and at the end of each shoot, a black whip like structure, full of fungal spores is produced.\n\nControl\nUse disease free and heat-treated setts for planting. Dip the setts in Carbendazim solution (0.1%) before planting at least for 30 minutes. Uproot and destroy the infected clumps. Avoid ratooning. Grow resistant varieties like CO-85004, CO-86032, CO-6608, CO-6609, CO-62101, CO-1342, CO-12582, CO-8021 and CO-62175.\n\nGrassy shoot disease\nThis disease is caused by Mycoplasma like organism and is severe on ratoon crop than on the main crop. Symptoms are stunting, profuse tillering and grass like growth of shoots (busy appearance) and yellowing of leaves with short internodes.\n\nControl\nUse disease free and heat-treated setts for planting. Uproot and destroy the infected clumps.\nAvoid ratooning. Spray Endosulfan (0.2%) to kill insect vectors i.e., aphids which transmit the disease. Use resistant varieties like CO-7219, CO-740, CO-8014 and CO-8011.\n\nHarvesting and yield\nAssessing the maturity of the cane crop\nThe maturity of sugarcane is generally recognized by the lower leaves gradually withering up and leaving progressively fewer green leaves at the top. A ripe cane, out across with a sharp knife, shows against sunlight a slight sparkling in its flesh in contrast to the more watery cut surface of an unripe cane. If the grower can keep and use a hand sugar refractometer, the testing of maturity would be easier. The hand refractometer reading of 20, the cane crop may be considered to have reached the stage of maturity. Small Mill Test (SMT) will be a real solution for this perennial problem. For conducting SMT, few canes (say about 10 canes) have to be cut from the field and the samples are analyzed after crushing the cane in a small mill for poll, brix, purity and ccs% in the laboratory which clearly gives the maturity status of the cane.\n\nHarvesting system and harvesting unit\nThe Cooperative generally begins the sugarcane harvest about the first of November and continues for an average of 150 days. The sugarcane harvest is timed and coordinated undertaking to allow for maximum utilization of the mill's grinding capacity.\n######################\nOutput:",

India is the world’s largest consumer and the second largest producer of sugar, topped only by Brazil. Nearly 2.8 lakh farmers have been cultivating sugarcane in the vast area of 4.4 lakh acres and over 11 crore people are directly or indirectly dependent on the sugar industry in the country. Sugarcane is one of the important commercial crops of India, grown in an area of 3.93 m.ha with annual production of 170 M.T. Sugarcane productivity in India is around 67 t/ha. It is one of the most important food-cum-cash crop grown in the country, providing employment to a larger number of people, in addition to earning considerable foreign exchange.\n\nRequirement\nClimate\nSugarcane is able to grow over a prolonged season. Under warm humid conditions, it can continue its growth, unless terminated by flowering. Temperatures above 50o C arrest its growth; those below 20 o C slow it down markedly and severe frost proves fatal. The crop does best in the tropical regions receiving a rainfall of 750-1200mm. For ripening, it needs a cool, dry season; but where rainfall is too heavy and prolonged, the quality of the juice tends to be low, and where the weather remains comparatively.\n\nSoil\nSugarcane grows best on medium heavy soils, but can also be raised on lighter soils and heavy clays, provided there is adequate irrigation available in the former type of soils and drainage is good in the latter type of soils. In many places, dark rich clay loams, 120-150cm deep, and lying on a previous substratum of murum (distintegrated traprock) ae used for this crop. In some areas.\n\nVarieties\nCO – 419, CO – 740, CO – 7219 (Sanjivini), CO.M – 7125, CO – 7527, CO.M – 88121(7714), CO –8014 (Mahalaxmi), CO – 86032 (Nira), CO.C – 671, CO.C – 85061, CO - 8011, CO.M. – 7114, CO.S.I – 776,\n\nPlanting\nSeed treatment\nThe availability of good quality cane seed materials (setts) from a nursery crop of 10-11 months are essential for better germination and good growth. The treatments included were namely control, 0.05% Bavistin, 2.5% Urea, 2.5% KCI, 2.5% KCI+Urea, 1% Hadron. Two budded setts were used for planting after treating with above chemicals. Also hot water treatment is given to prevent seed borne diseases.\n\nSowing\nPlanting of sugarcane is done in three seasons that is suru- January-February, adsali - July-August and pre seasonal- October-November for planting generally ridges and furrows are prepared on 100-120cm spacing. For planting one hectare area 25-30 thousand three eye buded cane setts are required.\n\nFertilizers\nAdequate manuring is essential for sustained high yields. The general recommendation in most places is to apply half to two-thirds of the nitrogen in the form of bulky organic manures, such as farmyard manure, compost, green manure or tree leaves, and the remainder in the form of ammonium sulphate or oil-cakes or a combination of the two. For sugarcane fertilizer is recommended according to planting season and it is varied from growing tract to tract. In general for suru sugarcane 250:115:115 for Adsali 400:170:170 and for pre seasonal 340:170:170 kg nitrogen, phosphorus and potash per hectare is recommended respectively. For ratooning 250:115:115kg nitrogen, phosphorus and potash per hectare is recommended.\n\nIrrigation\nWater requirement of sugarcane varies from 2000 to 2500 mm depending upon its duration, soil type and climatological factors. For sugarcane germination, tillering, grand growth and maturity are the critical stages for irrigation. During germination phase (1-35 days) there should be enough moisture in the soil for better germination but waterlogging is undesirable as it leads to rotting of setts. During this period irrigation can be scheduled at weekly intervals. But irrigation at 10 days interval during tillering stage (36-100 days) is sufficient. The formative and grand growth stages (101-270 days) are the critical stages for water demand. During this period irrigation can be practised at weekly intervals. At the maturity phase (271 days to harvest) fortnightly irrigation is enough. Irrigation will have to be stopped at 15 days prior to harvest.\n\nIntercultural operations\nMulching\nIn early days, application of paddy straw or spreading of sugarcane trash in the field will decrease the evaporation and thus decrease the water demand of the crop besides improving the yield.\n\nHoeing and earthing-up\nThe first hoeing an weeding should be given to the crop three to four weeks after planting. After germination, depending on the field conditions and the frequency of irrigation, two or three more hoeings and weedings may be required during the first three months after planting with the coming up of the crop. The final earthing-up should be completed before the monsoon rains, and should generally synchronize with the application of the final dose of fertilizer. This helps to keep down the weeds.\n\nTying of cane\nIt is very desirable to tie up the canes so that they may not sway during the winds, and lodge\n######################\nOutput:",

laboratory which clearly gives the maturity status of the cane.\\n\\nHarvesting system and harvesting unit\\nThe Cooperative generally begins the sugarcane harvest about the first of November and continues for an average of 150 days. The sugarcane harvest is timed and coordinated undertaking to allow for maximum utilization of the mill's grinding capacity. At present the harvesting and supply of sugarcane is done by the farmers after receiving the cutting orders from the factory authorities. The cutting orders are issued depending upon the date of planting as found in the records and agreement between the farmers and factory. This system will not hold good, as uniform maturity of the cane crop can’t be controlled even by planting early maturing varieties in the early season. In a typical harvesting unit, three or four harvesters operate in tandem with six to eight tractors and strings of wagons. The huge machines contain rotating knives, which cut the sugarcane at the base of the stalk.

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\nIntroduction\\nSugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) is the main sources of sugar in India and holds a prominent position as a cash crop. India is the world’s largest consumer and the second largest producer of sugar, topped only by Brazil. Nearly 2.8 lakh farmers have been cultivating sugarcane in the vast area of 4.4 lakh acres and over 11 crore people are directly or indirectly dependent on the sugar industry in the country. Sugarcane is one of the important commercial crops of India, grown in an area of 3.93 m.ha with annual production of 170 M.T. Sugarcane productivity in India is around 67 t/ha. It is one of the most important food-cum-cash crop grown in the country, providing employment to a larger number of people, in addition to earning considerable foreign exchange.\\n\\nRequirement\\nClimate\\nSugarcane is able to grow over a prolonged season. Under warm humid conditions, it can continue its growth, unless terminated by flowering. Temperatures above 50o C arrest its growth; those below 20 o C slow it down markedly and severe frost proves fatal. The crop does best in the tropical regions receiving a rainfall of 750-1200mm. For ripening, it needs a cool, dry season; but where rainfall is too heavy and prolonged, the quality of the juice tends to be low, and where the weather remains comparatively.\\n\\nSoil\\nSugarcane grows best on medium heavy soils, but can also be raised on lighter soils and heavy clays, provided there is adequate irrigation available in the former type of soils and drainage is good in the latter type of soils. In many places, dark rich clay loams, 120-150cm deep, and lying on a previous substratum of murum (distintegrated traprock) ae used for this crop. In some areas.\\n\\nVarieties\\nCO – 419, CO – 740, CO – 7219 (Sanjivini), CO.M – 7125, CO – 7527, CO.M – 88121(7714), CO –8014 (Mahalaxmi), CO – 86032 (Nira), CO.C – 671, CO.C – 85061, CO - 8011, CO.M. – 7114, CO.S.I – 776,\\n\\nPlanting\\nSeed treatment\\nThe availability of good quality cane seed materials (setts) from a nursery crop of 10-11 months are essential for better germination and good growth. The treatments included were namely control, 0.05% Bavistin, 2.5% Urea, 2.5% KCI, 2.5% KCI+Urea, 1% Hadron. Two budded setts were used for planting after treating with above chemicals. Also hot water treatment is given to prevent seed borne diseases.\\n\\nSowing\\nPlanting of sugarcane is done in three seasons that is suru- January-February, adsali - July-August and pre seasonal- October-November for planting generally ridges and furrows are prepared on 100-120cm spacing. For planting one hectare area 25-30 thousand three eye buded cane setts are required.\\n\\nFertilizers\\nAdequate manuring is essential for sustained high yields. The general recommendation in most places is to apply half to two-thirds of the nitrogen in the form of bulky organic manures, such as farmyard manure, compost, green manure or tree leaves, and the remainder in the form of ammonium sulphate or oil-cakes or a combination of the two. For sugarcane fertilizer is recommended according to planting season and it is varied from growing tract to tract. In general for suru sugarcane 250:115:115 for Adsali 400:170:170 and for pre seasonal 340:170:170 kg nitrogen, phosphorus and potash per hectare is recommended respectively. For ratooning 250:115:115kg nitrogen, phosphorus and potash per hectare is recommended.\\n\\nIrrigation\\nWater requirement of sugarcane varies from 2000 to 2500 mm depending upon its duration, soil type and climatological factors. For sugarcane germination, tillering, grand growth and maturity are the critical stages for irrigation. During germination phase (1-35 days) there should be enough moisture in the soil for better germination but waterlogging is undesirable as it leads to rotting of setts. During this period irrigation can be scheduled at weekly intervals. But irrigation at 10 days interval during tillering stage (36-100 days) is sufficient. The formative and grand growth stages (101-270 days) are the critical stages for water demand. During this period irrigation can be practised at weekly intervals. At the maturity phase (271 days to harvest) fortnightly irrigation is enough. Irrigation will have to be stopped at 15 days prior to harvest.\\n\\nIntercultural operations\\nMulching\\nIn early days, application of paddy straw or spreading of sugarcane trash in the field will decrease the evaporation and thus decrease the water demand of the crop besides improving the yield.\\n\\nHoeing and earthing-up\\nThe first hoeing an weeding should be given to the crop three to four weeks after planting. After germination, depending on the field conditions and the frequency of irrigation, two or three more hoeings and weedings may be required during the first three months after planting with the coming up of the crop. The final earthing-up should be completed before the monsoon rains, and should generally synchronize with the application of the final dose of fertilizer. This helps to keep down the weeds.\\n\\nTying of cane\\nIt is very desirable to tie up the canes so that they may not sway during the winds, and lodge\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\":

[organization,person,geo,event,category]\\nText:\\non the field conditions and the frequency of irrigation, two or three more hoeings and weedings may be required during the first three months after planting with the coming up of the crop. The final earthing-up should be completed before the monsoon rains, and should generally synchronize with the application of the final dose of fertilizer. This helps to keep down the weeds.\\n\\nTying of cane\\nIt is very desirable to tie up the canes so that they may not sway during the winds, and lodge. The best way to do the tying is to bring together the stalks from adjacent rows and tie them together with their own trash and old leaves. In many places cane is tied at two or three levels with twists of cane trash, the twistline going from one end of the row to the other; sometimes the stalks are further propped up with bamboos.\\n\\nPlant protection\\nPest\\nTermites\\nTermites are attack planted sugarcane setts, usually from the cut ends or eyebuds, but in severe cases internode as well; after germination, the roots are attacked and pest ascends in the canes, eating all their contents and filling the galleries with earth; leaves dry up and the plants die; more active in sandy soils and in drier tracts.\\n\\nControl\\nUse only well-rotted manure, mix thoroughly 5% Aldrin or Chlordane dust with the soil; if the standing crop is attacked, apply Aldrin E.C. at 3kg a.i/ha diluted with 2,000 litres of water as near the roots as possible.\\n\\nEarly shoot-borer\\nCausing dead-hearts which can be easily pulled out; the maximum activity is observed during April to August; responsible for serious losses in tonnage and sugar recovery.\\nControl\\nPractice cleans cultivation; plant healthy setts; give two light stage of the crop; avoid ratooning; systematically collect and destroy egg masses; remove dead-hearts and do deep harvesting.\\n\\nInternode borer\\nNewly hatched caterpillars scrape the leaf spindle; later, they bore into the tender cane tops; the growing-point is damaged and results in a dead-heart; active from July till harvest; the pest causes more loss in tonnage than in juice quality.\\n\\nControl\\nBurn all trash after harvest; Practice clean cultivation; collect and destroy egg masses and larvae during early stages of crop.\\n\\nDisease\\nRed rot\\nIt is a fungal disease. The symptoms of the disease will appear when the crop is about six months old. At the initial stage, drying of top leaves can be seen. The leaf starts withering and drooping almost all shoots in a clump starts drying one by one. Red lesions with straw coloured centres develop on the midrib of leaves.\\nControl\\nUproot and destroy all the clumps as soon as symptoms appear. Avoid ratooning. Use disease free and heat-treated setts for planting. After harvest, collect and burn the plant debris. Grow resistant varieties like CO-7706, CO-86032 and tolerant varieties are CO-8021 and CO-62175.\\nFollow crop rotation. Dip the setts in systemic fungicide Benomyl (0.1%) solution for at least 30 minutes before planting.\\n\\nWhip smut\\nIt is fungal disease. The symptoms can be seen on the crop from the time it is one month old upto harvesting time. The affected young plants show excessive tillering and at the end of each shoot, a black whip like structure, full of fungal spores is produced.\\n\\nControl\\nUse disease free and heat-treated setts for planting. Dip the setts in Carbendazim solution (0.1%) before planting at least for 30 minutes. Uproot and destroy the infected clumps. Avoid ratooning. Grow resistant varieties like CO-85004, CO-86032, CO-6608, CO-6609, CO-62101, CO-1342, CO-12582, CO-8021 and CO-62175.\\n\\nGrassy shoot disease\\nThis disease is caused by Mycoplasma like organism and is severe on ratoon crop than on the main crop. Symptoms are stunting, profuse tillering and grass like growth of shoots (busy appearance) and yellowing of leaves with short internodes.\\n\\nControl\\nUse disease free and heat-treated setts for planting. Uproot and destroy the infected clumps.\\nAvoid ratooning. Spray Endosulfan (0.2%) to kill insect vectors i.e., aphids which transmit the disease. Use resistant varieties like CO-7219, CO-740, CO-8014 and CO-8011.\\n\\nHarvesting and yield\\nAssessing the maturity of the cane crop\\nThe maturity of sugarcane is generally recognized by the lower leaves gradually withering up and leaving progressively fewer green leaves at the top. A ripe cane, out across with a sharp knife, shows against sunlight a slight sparkling in its flesh in contrast to the more watery cut surface of an unripe cane. If the grower can keep and use a hand sugar refractometer, the testing of maturity would be easier. The hand refractometer reading of 20, the cane crop may be considered to have reached the stage of maturity. Small Mill Test (SMT) will be a real solution for this perennial problem. For conducting SMT, few canes (say about 10 canes) have to be cut from the field and the samples are analyzed after crushing the cane in a small mill for poll, brix, purity and ccs% in the laboratory which clearly gives the maturity status of the cane.\\n\\nHarvesting system and harvesting unit\\nThe Cooperative generally begins the sugarcane harvest about the first of November and continues for an average of 150 days. The sugarcane harvest is timed and coordinated undertaking to allow for maximum utilization of the mill's grinding capacity.\\n######################\\nOutput:\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Sugarcane\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Sugarcane is a crop requiring specific agricultural practices such as irrigation, hoeing, and protection from pests and diseases for optimal yield.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Termites\\\"<|>\\\"pest\\\"<|>\\\"Termites are pests that attack planted sugarcane setts, damaging the roots and canes, and can lead to plant death.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Early Shoot-Borer\\\"<|>\\\"pest\\\"<|>\\\"Early shoot-borer is a pest that affects sugarcane, causing dead-hearts and is most active from April to August.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Internode Borer\\\"<|>\\\"pest\\\"<|>\\\"Internode borer is a caterpillar pest active from July until harvest, damaging the growing points of sugarcane plants.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Red Rot\\\"<|>\\\"disease\\\"<|>\\\"Red rot is a fungal disease affecting sugarcane, characterized by symptoms appearing when the crop is about six months old.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Whip Smut\\\"<|>\\\"disease\\\"<|>\\\"Whip smut is a fungal disease that appears from one month old to harvest, leading to excessive tillering and producing a black whip-like structure.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Grassy Shoot Disease\\\"<|>\\\"disease\\\"<|>\\\"Grassy shoot disease is caused by a Mycoplasma-like organism, resulting in stunted growth and yellowing of leaves.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Control Measures\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Control measures encompass various strategies employed to mitigate pest attacks and diseases in sugarcane cultivation.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Harvesting\\\"<|>\\\"event\\\"<|>\\\"Harvesting refers to the process of collecting mature sugarcane, which is usually coordinated over a 150-day period starting in November.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Sugarcane Planting and Care Techniques\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"The techniques include irrigation management, hoeings, tying of canes, and pest and disease control to ensure healthy growth of sugarcane.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Sugarcane\\\"<|>\\\"Termites\\\"<|>\\\"Termites pose a threat to sugarcane by attacking the planted setts and damaging the crop lead to its death.\\\"<|>\\\"pest threat, agricultural impact\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Sugarcane\\\"<|>\\\"Early Shoot-Borer\\\"<|>\\\"Early shoot-borer is a pest that directly affects sugarcane by causing dead-hearts and reduces the overall yield.\\\"<|>\\\"pest threat, agricultural pest\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Sugarcane\\\"<|>\\\"Internode Borer\\\"<|>\\\"Internode borers damage the growing points of sugarcane, impacting growth and yield potential.\\\"<|>\\\"crop damage, pest impact\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Red Rot\\\"<|>\\\"Sugarcane\\\"<|>\\\"Red rot disease affects sugarcane, resulting in wilting and decay of the plants over time.\\\"<|>\\\"disease impact, agricultural concern\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Whip Smut\\\"<|>\\\"Sugarcane\\\"<|>\\\"Whip smut results in excessive tillering and affects the growth of sugarcane, especially when young.\\\"<|>\\\"disease impact, agricultural concern\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Grassy Shoot Disease\\\"<|>\\\"Sugarcane\\\"<|>\\\"Grassy shoot disease affects sugarcane through stunted growth and yellowing of leaves, impacting overall health.\\\"<|>\\\"disease impact, agricultural threat\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Control Measures\\\"<|>\\\"Termites\\\"<|>\\\"Control measures are necessary to manage termite infestations in sugarcane cultivation to protect the crop.\\\"<|>\\\"pest management, agricultural practices\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Control Measures\\\"<|>\\\"Red Rot\\\"<|>\\\"Control measures are employed to address the impact of red rot disease on sugarcane cultivation.\\\"<|>\\\"disease management, agricultural practices\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Harvesting\\\"<|>\\\"Sugarcane\\\"<|>\\\"Harvesting is the culmination of the sugarcane growth process, taking place after the crop reaches maturity.\\\"<|>\\\"crop collection, agricultural process\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"sugarcane cultivation, pest management, disease control, harvesting practices\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
